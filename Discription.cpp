Project Description:-

The AI ChatBot in C++ is an interactive console-based program designed to simulate human-like conversations using simple keyword-based artificial intelligence. This chatbot accepts user input, analyzes the message, and responds appropriately based on pre-defined rules and a dynamic response database.

The chatbot is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, leveraging classes, maps, strings, and algorithms to create an efficient conversational model. It can recognize greetings, personal queries, and general questions, providing suitable answers for each. Users can communicate naturally through the console interface, making it a simple yet effective demonstration of AI-based interaction using C++.

One of the key highlights of this chatbot is its extendability and learning feature. The system can be enhanced to “learn” new responses from users and store them in a text file, allowing it to remember new questions and answers in future sessions. This gives the chatbot a sense of memory and adaptability, a fundamental concept in modern AI systems.

This project not only demonstrates the logical and algorithmic power of C++ but also showcases how basic artificial intelligence concepts can be implemented through pattern recognition, text processing, and dynamic data structures.
